```
class Lawyer: public Employee {

}
```
Overriding: you have to use the ```virtual``` keyword in both superclass and subclass.
Call superclass constructor:
```
Lawyer::Lawyer(string name, string school) : Employee(string name)
```
## Abstract function / interface
```
class Employee {
    virtual void work() = 0;
}
```
## Multiple inheritance
```
class Name: public sc1, public sc2 {...}
```


# Hashing
- collision: two values have same index.
- probing: looking around to resolve a collisoin; linear probind or quadratic probing.
- separate chaining: solving collisions by storing a list at each index. nice -- impossible to run out of indices, unlike with probing.
