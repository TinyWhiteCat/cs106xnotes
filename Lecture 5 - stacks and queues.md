# Stacks and Queues
Wed 10/4/2017
***stack*** - add/remove from "top" only.
***queue*** - add to "back" only; remove from "front" only.

## Stacks
- LIFO - last in, first out. Like a stack of books.
- elements are stored in order of insertion; don't think of it as having indexes.
  - one can only add/remove/view the top element (last added).
- push - add element to top
- pop - remove top element
- peek - examine the top element
Use: "undo stack", backtracking, forward / reverse, functions/compilers use stacks.
